# Renderer_cpp
Monte Carlo Ray Tracer for Rendering Realistic Scenes

Program developed as part of Comupational Phyics Class at OSU

To compile: make -f make_render

To run and check time executed: time ./render

This program will use all your cores to calculate the scene so be forwarned.

I also included extra scenes to render in the aptly named scenes file. I reccomend the wada scene so see how fast this program can render an image.
